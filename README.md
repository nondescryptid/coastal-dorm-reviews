This is a csv containing Google Reviews for Coastal Dormitory, which is a workers' dormitory located inside a Changi Airport construction site. I was intrigued by this public source of opinions about life inside the dorm -- which is inaccessible to the public (you can't take a cab there and expect to enter). 

I decided to scrape the reviews as looking at the numeric rating (stars out of 5) is not the best indication of sentiment, as there are some reviews with negative sentiment (in the caption column) that gave a rating of 5 stars. 

This was gathered using [googlemaps-scraper](https://github.com/gaspa93/googlemaps-scraper) by gaspa93.
